The simulation code is divided into 2 parts. In the first part, we use a simulation with 10,000 replications to see the most likely profit value of a bookstore considering its expenses and demands.

The time series forecasting code looks at COVID data and compares ARIMA and Neural Network model to incorporate in the training set. Later, the accuracy and errors are compared using the models under forecast function and an ensemble is created using the two models to produce an ensemble with lowerst RMSE>
